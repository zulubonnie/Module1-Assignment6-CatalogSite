        <h2>About us</h2>
        <p><b>Paint Palace was born in 2016 in Durban, South Africa. The dream was simple. Give independent artists a meaningful new way to sell their creations. Today, we connect over 700,000 artists and designers across the planet with millions of passionate fans. A brave (and dare we say stylish) new world of self expression.</b></p>
            <p><b>At The Paint Palace, we celebrate creativity,
                openness, tolerance, and generosity. We aim to be inclusive places—
                both onsite and online—where diverse cultural, artistic, social, and
                political positions are welcome. We’re committed to sharing the
                most thought-provoking modern and contemporary art, and hope
                you will join us in exploring the art, ideas, and issues of our time.
                Creativity is in our DNA. Our game-changing innovations are redefining the possibilities of digital experiences. We connect content and data and introduce new technologies that democratize creativity, shape the next generation of storytelling, and inspire entirely new categories of business.
                We believe everybody has a story to tell. Adobe Creative Cloud unleashes creativity so anyone — from the most demanding professional to students just starting out — can make whatever they want, wherever they want
