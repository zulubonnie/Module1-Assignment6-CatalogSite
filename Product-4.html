           <h4>Art Description:</h4>
             <p><b>Paula Christenson is an intuitive abstract painter who lives in Humble, Texas. She states, “My art is a colorful web where solid shapes and varied lines interact to keep the viewer in a playful atmosphere of exploration and imagination.”
              As a child growing up in Argentina, Paula displayed signs of innate artistic talent in both painting and sculpture. Her mother enrolled her in art classes and at the age of 12 her art was selected for exhibitions and awards. The continued support she received from her family cemented Paula’s confidence and desire to explore her creativity which has expanded and evolved.
              Paula graduated with honors from the Institute of Teacher Formation, Buenos Aires, Argentina and has served as an educator for children. Currently, she combines her love for creating art with education and explains, “Using art in my teaching practice is a powerful resource that helps students process the world around them in a collaborative and exciting way.”
              Paula’s exhibitions include those in the Kinder Morgan Building at the Glassell School of Art, MFAH, in Houston, Texas, which was founded as part of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston.
              Her painting “Dreamweb 6” was recently selected by Gallery CERO for an online presentation in which artists shared their pandemic stories. About this painting she emphasized, “While one’s interpretation of ‘DW6’ could be chaos and conflict, I see something more. There is bravery in the struggle – a willingness to face our fears and confront the present struggle with a resolute energy. Our dreams continue.”
              With a relentless desire to advance her professional skills, Paula is currently attending the Glassell School of Art and is working toward obtaining a certification in Painting. She is a proud member of Latin American Women Artists of Houston.</p>
