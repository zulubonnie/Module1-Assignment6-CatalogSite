           <h4>Art Description</h4>
           <p><b>
              As a Color Field painter Bienert pursues color relationships with fervor. Her palette is innovative and complex. She mixes more than 25 different oil paints to create every color in her painting.
              Due to the large scale of her paintings, her pictorial scheme appears to extend beyond our peripheral vision. She is an optical illusionist whose art defies spacial limitations. Colorful patterns advance and recede, undulate and coalesce. They emulate the manner in which the universe operates in the energetic realms of both the microcosm and macrocosm.
              Bienertâ€™s use of both organic shapes and pixelated forms serve as references to living organisms as well as the world of technology. These patterns cohabitate in harmony, often superimposed upon the other, to create a reverie of unpredictable movement and transparent effects.
              The artist brings an extensive mastery of color theory, innate sense of rhythm, and compositional elements to each painting. Her art is visual poetry bursting forth with relentless energetic expression.
              Bienert has developed her own visual vocabulary and inimitable style. With utmost proficiency she invites us to view the world as a magical, fluid and invigorating panorama. Through her paintings we experience our universe with a new expansive and compelling perspective</b></p>
