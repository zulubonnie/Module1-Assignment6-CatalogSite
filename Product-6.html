           <h4>Art Description:</h4>
             <p><b>John Simona was born in Argentina and currently lives in San Francisco, California. He graduated from UC Berkeley and received a scholarship to SF Academy of Art.
              His art reflects his interest in travel and culture. He juxtaposes elements of reality with surrealism using paint, charcoal, and digital art. His rhythmic compositions convey feelings of whimsy with elements of surprise.
              In addition to original works of art John offers limited edition prints on archival, museum quality paper. His art is sold through many interior designers and art consultants.
              John’s many exhibitions include those held at the San Diego Art Museum and at the Ace Academy in San Francisco. He won an Award of Excellence in “Artists for Peace” presented by Manhattan Arts International.
              His art is found in many private collections in the U.S. and several public collections namely the Horace Bank and Dudley Insurance Co., both in California.<br><br>
